# Phase-2-Project-Student-Reports-App

## Overview
This is a one-page app that allows a user to write, save, and view progress reports for students in a school setting. They also can add students to the database, including classes the new student is registered in.

Future functionality is planned for full management (addition, deletion, and class enrollment changes) of students by admin, as well as similar class management. Multiple user logins, admin credentials, and online hosting are future goals, as well.
